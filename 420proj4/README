To run the program run make
then run ./a.out DPLL filename -unit or  ./a.out DPLL filename (for without the uch fucntion)

Example ./a.out DPLL mapcolor.cnf
or ./a.out DPLL mapcolor.cnf -unit

It should output the number of clauses satisfied by the model and then which call to the DPLL it was

If it fails to find a valid model the final message should say unsatisfiable.
