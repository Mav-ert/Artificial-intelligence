To run the program run make

It should output success after printing the steps and then the final knowledge base

If it fails to find a valid model or after 10000 iterations the final message should say failure. 

I want to note that i modified the MCL hueristic so it would only count the number of literals when all duplicates were removed. This seemed to improve the performance of the algorithm. Though I'm not sure if this is what the instructions given implied or if we were to actually count the number of literals in both clauses in the pair.
