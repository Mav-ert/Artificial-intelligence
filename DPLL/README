This project uses DPLL algorithm to find a valid model given a set of clauses in a 
file. The clauses should be in cnf form.

To run the program run make
then run ./a.out DPLL filename -unit or  ./a.out DPLL filename (for without the uch fucntion)

Example ./a.out DPLL mapcolor.cnf
or ./a.out DPLL mapcolor.cnf -unit
a.exe DPLL filename -unit (on windows)
It should output the number of clauses satisfied by the model and then which call to the DPLL it was

If it fails to find a valid model the final message should say unsatisfiable.
